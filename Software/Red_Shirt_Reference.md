#Communications Probe: Red Shirt Reference

REPRINT CODE: 911911

##Hints
The first level of hinting for each puzzle is to ensure that Curtis has identified the correct names for each image shown on the tricorder (NOT the communications probe so we preserve some puzzling for figuring out those names once the tricorder pattern is recognized). This can be done in character, “e.g. Sir, perhaps the research we’ve done could identify the names of one or two of those images for you. Which ones would you like to know more about?” followed by “Our research indicates that dog is known as a SCOTTY”. Or if he has any incorrect names, “Our research suggests the name for that image is incorrect.”

If he’s really stuck on the names for any of the communications probe images after understanding the tricorder pattern, we can give those in character as well, but only once it’s clear he understands the tricorder pattern.

##Minipuzzle 1
- Tricorder images: HERO, SAX, ORE, WINE 
- Tricorder numbers: 0, 6, 1, 9
- Communications Probe images: HOUR, NIKE, LIGHT, FILE 
- Communications Probe numbers to enter: 4, 9, 8, 5

Scheme: image name is one letter off from a digit name
Further hints:
- Sir, it looks like those tricorder lights are some kind of encoding.- Perhaps we should compare each image to the number.- Maybe if we spelled out those numbers we would find something.
##Minipuzzle 2
- Tricorder images: ARCHER, SCOTTY, YAR, DATA
- Tricorder numbers: 5, 1, 2, 2- Communications Probe images: QUARK, BONES, 7 OF 9, PARIS 
- Communications Probe numbers to enter: 3, 1, 4, 4

Scheme: the series number the character is from (1=TOS, 2=TNG, 3=DS9, 4=Voyager, 5=Enterprise)
Further hints:
- Sir, our analysis suggests these are all from our universe- Our research suggests they may be people- In fact, you might have met Data and Yar- I think I’ve heard the name Scotty before — wasn’t he from the generation before us?

##Minipuzzle 3
- Tricorder images: BEET, XBOX, RAFT, PEEL
- Tricorder numbers: 14, 3, 13, 7- Communications Probe images: BATH, TAPE, BOWL, CART 
- Communications Probe numbers to enter: 14, 7, 7, 13

Scheme: The four binary bits of the numbers select letters in the word and vice-versa (beet/bee, xbox/ox, raft/rat, peel/eel, bath/bat, tape/ape, bowl/owl, cart/cat)

Further hints:
- Sir, those words all seem to have 4 letters- Sir, our analysis suggests the tricorder may be providing some kind of mask- Our analysis suggests it might be useful to apply the 4-light mask to each word

##Minipuzzle 4
For the initial hinting to give Curtis the full set of names, provide only the names of the items, not the color in parentheses that they suggest.
- Tricorder images: MARS (THE RED PLANET), WASP (YELLOW JACKET), FRANK SINATRA (OLD BLUE EYES), CAKE (RED VELVET CAKE, SPECIFICALLY) 
- Tricorder numbers: 1, 3, 5, 1
- Communications Probe images: SEATTLE (THE EMERALD CITY), GARDENER (GREEN THUMB), SAD PERSON (FEELING BLUE), IBM (BIG BLUE) 
- Communications Probe numbers to enter: 4, 4, 5, 5

Scheme: color indexes into the rainbow (ROYGBIV)
Further hints:
- Sir, our research suggests that the humanoid known as Frank Sinatra ha d a nickname.- Sir, our research suggests that this may be a specific type of cake.- We’re seeing that the planet Mars may also have a nickname.- Some of those nicknames look quite colorful.- If he isn’t aware of the color nicknames/names for these, provide them (e.g. Sir, it turns out Frank Sinatra was known as Old Blue Eyes).

##Minipuzzle 5
- Tricorder images: WONDER BREAD, ANALGESICS, GATORADE, GEORDI LA FORGE
- Tricorder numbers: 1, 6, 8, 4- Communications Probe images: UNIFORM, CANINE, SKATER, TEST TUBE
- Communications Probe numbers to enter: 4, 9, 8, 2

Scheme: number contained in the phonemes of the words (Gateorade/eight, La Forge/four)
Further hints:
- Sir, these words certainly do *sound* very interesting.- Hmmm... WON-der bread, what could that be trying to tell us? (continue with this approach a few times)
