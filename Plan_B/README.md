#The "Plan B" Tricorder

In the event of a problem, this iPhone webapp can take the place of the Tricorder. Various problems might include:

- Damaged Tricorder
- We get the RF working against test devices, but the Communications Probe and Tricorder simply don't integrate and can't talk to one another.
- RF interference that prevent the two devices from working in particular locations in the field.
- Any and all other sorts of acts of the gods

So this is a webapp that will let you see the various Tricorder screens without needing to communicate via RF to the Communications Probe.

##Prerequisites
