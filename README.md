#Design Decisions

I cut some corners to accelerate development and minimize risk.  I wanted to work a few weeks of "uh oh" into the timetable as well as be able to focus on the software and presentation.  Namely:

- I used an off-the-shelf microcontroller board: the Arduino.  It's large and a little slow by microcontroller standards, but board bring-up is easy and there are hundreds of premade/pre-tested hardware accessory libraries.
- I used no batteries. The printer eats a ton of power. I didn't want to spend money on hefty batteries, which would tempt prolonged use, which in turn heightens the risk of dead batteries at a critical time.
- The case is a simple laser-cut acrylic box of a design similar to the [InfoNinja][] and my [nameplate][] using tabs, slots, and bolted mortise and tension joints.

#Software Overview

Makes use of the Arduino IDE plus several 3rd party libraries:
- screen
- printer
- button matrix

#Tasks

- [X] Determine pin connections.
- [ ] Wire it up on the bench:
    - [ ] Test each device, individually:
        - [ ] For each external device, on by one, hook it up to the default pins.
        - [ ] Verify the library can communicate with the device.
        - [ ] Move the device to your desired final set of pins.
        - [ ] Verify the library can communicate on the new set of pins.
    - [ ] Test all devices in unison:
        - [ ] Start with one device, ensure it works.
        - [ ] Add another, ensure they work in tandem.
        - [ ] Add the next, etc.
- [ ] Preliminary software
    - [ ] Boot sequence animation (and also print test output on printer?)
    - [ ] Data entry screen
    - [ ] "Incorrect" animation (with delay to help discourage brute forcing)
    - [ ] Several incorrect answers in a row has longer delay?
    - [ ] Each "correct" behavior (screen, printer)
- [ ] Enclosure (black 3MM acrylic)
    - [ ] Determine internal parts placement.
    - [ ] Preliminary laser cut pattern.
    - [ ] Left/Right sides symmetric/interchangeable?
    - [ ] Print on paper, verify parts fit, verify pieces interlock correctly.
    - [ ] Send to Ponoko.
    - [ ] Hole for reprogramming?  "warranty void if removed" sticker?
- [ ] Advanced/optional software
    - [ ] Bitmaps for screen and printer
        - [ ] LCARS
        - [ ] Starfleet logo
        - [ ] Trek/communicator logo
